My understanding of the GUI and the Command-Line-Interface is that they both
have the same functions but the Command- Line- Interface breaks
everything down to code.
 It takes everything back to the beginning,  instead of being able to just
 click things at the surface level ( Graphic User Interface).
The CLI is another way of doing commands just with short cuts and loopholes etc.
I donâ€™t know much about code but the basic understanding of
how it works sticks with me, not so much the actual coding procedures
itself but I know with practice, I will.
